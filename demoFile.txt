What is the simplest way to create a file using a command-line? Usually I use:

touch filename

But is this the simplest/fastest way?
command-line bash files gnome-terminal

This will save you five keypresses relative to touch filename

>filename

but is not the equivalent of touch as it will truncate filename if it exists. The following does what you want

>>filename

but note that it is not equivalent to touch either, as it does not update filename's modification timestamp.

Could also add alias t='touch' to your .bashrc :P –  Der Flatulator Sep 23 '13 at 9:19
